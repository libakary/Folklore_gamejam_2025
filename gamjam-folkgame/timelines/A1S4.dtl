Fox: Have you tried befriending plants, too?
Protag: Yes, but we don’t have much to talk. All they seem to care about is growing up into the sky, as high as they can manage. I can’t relate to that.
Fox: How about the mushrooms? Ever listened to the chanterelles…
Protag: YES. And they just keep chanting “Work hard, and sugars will follow. Work hard, and sugars will follow…”
Protag: I can’t deal with such workaholics. Sorry. I appreciate what they do for the forest, but I would rather keep to creatures who know how to play and have fun.
Fox: Yeah, I can see that. I remember you liked to connect acorns and leaves with tiny sticks growing up and all kinds of stuff I think no other spirit ever thought of before.
Protag:  I still like to do that! Let me collect some acorns real fast and I will show you how my skills have improved.
