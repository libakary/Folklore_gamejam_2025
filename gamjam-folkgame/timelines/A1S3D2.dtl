Eva: Spirits know what all the animals, plants, mushrooms and other forest life enjoys the most.
Eva: We learn it in school.
Protag: That’s true, I was there with you.
Protag:  I kind of forgot most of it though…
Protag: Assuming I was even awake. I kind of zoned out or was asleep on the moss a lot.
Eva: Yeah, because you preferred to stay up all night drawing images in the sky with your fingers or talking to animals.
Protag: Hey, most of them are nocturnal, or active in the twilight zone between sunset or sunrise and darkness. If you want to talk to them, you have to be up when they are.
Protag: And I just really like making friends with all the ones living here. They’re cool, and some are probably lonely.
